## Real-Time Face Landmark Detection and Face Shape 

## Overview

This project captures facial landmarks from real-time video, extracts features based on these landmarks. The program uses OpenCV for face detection, Dlib for facial landmark detection.

## Features

- Real-time face detection and landmark extraction
- Visualization of facial landmarks and intermediate points in the video feed
